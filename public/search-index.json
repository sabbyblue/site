[{"content":"\rThis is Grace the bunny! She loves to have fun, whether out and about playing sports or learning at school (and home!) She\u0026rsquo;s my mascot for the GNOME project.\nHer design choices go as follows:\nGrace is a child. GNOME Desktop is made to be simple and consistent so that young people will have an easier time using their computer, whether it be to learn or play. (GNOME Games) Grace is disabled! She wears prosthetic arms. Accessibility is at the core of GNOME\u0026rsquo;s philosophy; that it may benefit every person. Grace is a girl. Women and girls are underrepresented in software development, and it\u0026rsquo;s essential to allow us a voice and encourage more girls to be interested in the area. She\u0026rsquo;s a rabbit! GNOME\u0026rsquo;s long time icon is a small foot. And rabbits\u0026rsquo; feet are said to give good luck. I like that symbolism. The project is changing rapidly, and luck doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. Her name and appearance are not final. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of some cool changes like longer hair, or even making her a jackalope to complement KDE\u0026rsquo;s antlered dragon, Konqi.\n","date":"2024-06-01","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/grace/","summary":"This is Grace the bunny!

It is said that she was a personal assistant bot who found herself flung onto a time vortex of unknown destination. She wound up in prehistoric Europe, where she will alter the timeline by teaching the nearby settlements about science and technology. It is believed she eventually assumes the role of king, or even god, revered for her advancements and role in the founding of the first civilization.\n(She\u0026rsquo;s so cute BTW!!)\n","date":"2024-05-31","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/original_character/","summary":"Primus Machina Primus is one of my most recent developments.

I\u0026rsquo;m Sabby!! I like to draw as a hobby. I also advocate for the open source software that I use daily. I\u0026rsquo;ve used variations of Linux full-time for about 5 years now- that\u0026rsquo;s a lot! My daily driver as of today is Fedora Workstation. I\u0026rsquo;m a long time GNOME fan. I like to use apps from Flathub when available. I use Krita to produce digital art (made by KDE). Please consider supporting these projects.
