[{"content":"Primus Machina Primus is one of my most recent developments. It is said that she was a personal assistant bot who found herself flung onto a time vortex of unknown destination. She wound up in prehistoric Europe, where she will alter the timeline by teaching the nearby settlements about science and technology. It is believed she eventually assumes the role of king, or even god, revered for her advancements and role in the founding of the first civilization.\n(She\u0026rsquo;s so cute BTW!!)\n","date":"2024-05-31","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/original_character/","summary":"Primus Machina Primus is one of my most recent developments.

I\u0026rsquo;m Sabby!! I like to draw as a hobby. I also advocate for the open source software that I use daily. I\u0026rsquo;ve used variations of Linux full-time for about 5 years now- that\u0026rsquo;s a lot! My daily driver as of today is Fedora Workstation. I\u0026rsquo;m a long time GNOME fan. I like to use apps from Flathub when available. I use Krita to produce digital art (made by KDE). Please consider supporting these projects. (\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking to submit my drawings here, and maybe write some opinion pieces. Thanks for reading! Cheers!\nPS: Special thanks to blahaj.land for hosting the site! And be sure to check out Zoey and the critter\u0026rsquo;s places as well! Cheers!\n","date":"2024-05-31","id":3,"permalink":"/","summary":"sabby@blue:~$ mommy hugo\rHi! I\u0026rsquo;m Sabby!!
