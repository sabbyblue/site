I\u0026rsquo;m Sabby!! I like to draw as a hobby. I also advocate for the open source software that I use daily. I\u0026rsquo;ve used variations of Linux full-time for about 5 years now- that\u0026rsquo;s a lot! My daily driver as of today is Fedora Workstation. I\u0026rsquo;m a long time GNOME fan. I like to use apps from Flathub when available. I use Krita to produce digital art (made by KDE). Please consider supporting these projects.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking to submit my drawings here, and maybe write some opinion pieces. Thanks for reading! Cheers!\nPS: Special thanks to blahaj,land for hosting the site! And be sure to check out Zoey and the critter\u0026rsquo;s places as well!
